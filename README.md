This Git repository is about the Internship on Java Programming from Oasis Infobyte.
This repository includes two Java files. They are Task-1 and Task-2 which were given by Oasis Infobye as part of the internship.
As an Intern, I've successfully completed the given two tasks.

Task-1: Online Reservation System: 
    In this, I've worked with Java Swing and JDBC. This is designed to be a fully functional and user-friendly system.

Task-2: Number Guessing Game:
    This is a small number guessing game which I developed using Java Swing and also Random Library in Java
